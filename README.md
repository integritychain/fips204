[FIPS 204] Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard written in pure/safe Rust for server, 
desktop, browser and embedded applications. The source repository includes examples demonstrating benchmarking,
an embedded target, constant-time statistical measurements, fuzzing, WASM execution, and robust test coverage.

This crate implements the FIPS 204 **released** standard in pure Rust with minimal and mainstream dependencies, and
without any unsafe code. All three security parameter sets are fully functional and tested. The implementation's 
key- and signature-generation functionality operates in constant-time, does not require the standard library, e.g. 
`#[no_std]`, has no heap allocations, e.g. no `alloc` needed, and exposes the `RNG` so it is suitable for the full 
range of applications down to the bare-metal. The API is stabilized and the code is heavily biased towards safety 
and correctness; further performance optimizations will be implemented over time. This crate will quickly follow 
any changes related to FIPS 204 as they become available (e.g., pick up more test vectors).

See <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.204.pdf> for a full description of the target functionality.

The functionality is extremely simple to use, as demonstrated by the following example.

~~~rust
// Use the desired target parameter set.
# use std::error::Error;
#
# fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> { 
# #[cfg(all(feature = "ml-dsa-44", feature = "default-rng"))] { 
use fips204::ml_dsa_44; // Could also be ml_dsa_65 or ml_dsa_87. 
use fips204::traits::{SerDes, Signer, Verifier};
let message = [0u8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];

// Generate key pair and signature
let (pk1, sk) = ml_dsa_44::try_keygen()?;  // Generate both public and secret keys
let sig = sk.try_sign(&message, &[])?;  // Use the secret key to generate a message signature

// Serialize then send the public key, message and signature
let (pk_send, msg_send, sig_send) = (pk1.into_bytes(), message, sig);
let (pk_recv, msg_recv, sig_recv) = (pk_send, msg_send, sig_send);

// Deserialize the public key and signature, then verify the message
let pk2 = ml_dsa_44::PublicKey::try_from_bytes(pk_recv)?;
let v = pk2.verify(&msg_recv, &sig_recv, &[]); // Use the public to verify message signature
assert!(v);
    
// Note that the last argument to sign() and verify() is the (NIST specified) context
// value which is typically empty for basic signature generation and verification.
# }
# Ok(())
# }

## Notes

* This crate is fully functional and corresponds to the final released FIPS 204 (August 13, 2024).
* **BEWARE:** As of November 8, 2024 NIST has not released top-level/external/hash test vectors!
* Constant-time assurances target the source-code level only, with confirmation via
  manual review/inspection, the embedded target, and the `dudect` dynamic/statistical measurements.
* Note that FIPS 204 places specific requirements on randomness per section 3.6.1, hence the exposed `RNG`.
* Requires Rust **1.70** or higher. The minimum supported Rust version may be changed in the future, but 
  it will be done with a minor version bump (once the major version is larger than 0).
* All on-by-default features of this library are covered by `SemVer`.
* The FIPS 204 standard and this software should be considered experimental -- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
